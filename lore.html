        Venrora Yesdi is a dryad, who was born in Africa, and sent away by her
        parents for her protection. She was found off the coast of the Awakened
        Outback in Australia by a man she lovingly dubbed 'Redback'- because he
        was always very sunburned.
      </p>
      <p class="lore">
        Growing up in the Awakened Outback was nerve-wracking, but she learned
        quickly how to protect herself from the wildlife- the nation's biggest
        threat at the time.
      </p>
      <p class="lore">
        It was one day, though, that she found herself standing on a ship as it
        started sailing. Leaving Australia was an accident, but either way, she
        found herself standing at the port of a shipping company in
        Tenochtitlan, Aztl√°n.
      </p>
      <p class="lore">
        It took a while, but eventually, she found a way to get comfortable in
        the new country. She was surprised though, to find a stranded child in
        the midst of the road.
        <a href="https://youtu.be/d93j5w1WH4Y?feature=shared" id="MOTHA">
          It was an easy decision, and Alcaudon joined her little journey to
          live a nice life.</a
        >
      </p>
      <p class="lore">
        At some point, Venrora realized that she is a technomancer, or a person
        who can access the internet without a device- because she is the device.
        Despite being a dryad, she uses this to her advantage, carefully
        attempting to hack the mega-ultra-corporations that have been rumoured
        to run a <em>Dryad farm</em> in the midst of the heavily forested areas
        of South America.
      </p>
      <p class="lore">
        Unfortunately, because of her hacking partner, she is caught and- when
        we do start playing the campaign- she will start her new journey sat in
        a prison in yet another country, split from
        <a href="alca.html" id="MOTHA">the child</a> that she'd grown so
        attached to.
